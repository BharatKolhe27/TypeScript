Task Manager App

Created with Vite + React + TypeScript.

I am learning React and TypeScript, so I created a Task Manager project to practice.

In this project, I learned about basic types like string and number, and how to create them. I also learned about interfaces and type aliases in TypeScript.

Task Manager UI

This is how my Task Manager looks:


Example of Types I Used (Interface)

I also practiced creating interfaces and type aliases for my components:


<img width="360" height="161" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/90b06a94-de88-406d-b62d-6918720bd4a9" />


// type alias for component props
type TaskFormProps = {
  onAddTask: (title: string) => void
}


Features I Built

Add new tasks

Mark tasks as completed

Delete tasks

Show list of tasks


What I Learned

TypeScript basic types (string, number, boolean)

How to create interfaces

How to create type aliases
